### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm looking for a new frontend role :) Hire me ðŸ™Œ

I've worked in digital agencies and product-oriented companies; from heavy UI websites to heavy logic products.

Used Vue and React. Love working with CSS. Care about web accessibility and UX.

Totally cool with testing, typescript and following standards.

Repositories here are mostly code challenges or pet projects.
